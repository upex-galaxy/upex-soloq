## 🎯 Objective

Create a comprehensive glossary of domain terms that:

1. Helps QA understand business terminology
2. Ensures consistent language in test cases and bug reports
3. Maps technical names to business concepts

---

## 🔍 Discovery Process

### Step 1: Entity/Model Discovery

**Actions:**

1. Find model/entity files:

   ```bash
   # TypeScript/JavaScript projects
   find . -name "*.model.ts" -o -name "*.entity.ts" -o -name "*.schema.ts" 2>/dev/null

   # Prisma schema
   cat prisma/schema.prisma 2>/dev/null

   # TypeORM entities
   ls src/entities/ src/models/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. If Supabase MCP available:

   ```
   Use mcp__supabase to list all tables and their columns
   ```

3. Extract entity names and their attributes

**Output format:**

```
Entity: [TechnicalName]
- Business name: [What users call it]
- Description: [What it represents]
- Key attributes: [Important fields]
```

### Step 2: Enum/Constant Discovery

**Actions:**

1. Find enum definitions:

   ```bash
   grep -r "enum\|const.*=" --include="*.ts" src/types/ src/constants/ 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. Look for status/state values:

   ```bash
   grep -r "status\|state\|type" --include="*.ts" -A5 src/
   ```

3. Check for business-specific constants:
   ```bash
   cat src/constants/*.ts src/config/constants.ts 2>/dev/null
   ```

**Output format:**

```
Enum: [Name]
Values:
- [VALUE_1]: [Business meaning]
- [VALUE_2]: [Business meaning]
```

### Step 3: Relationship Discovery

**Actions:**

1. Analyze foreign keys:

   ```bash
   # Prisma relations
   grep -A2 "@relation" prisma/schema.prisma 2>/dev/null

   # TypeORM relations
   grep -B2 -A2 "ManyToOne\|OneToMany\|ManyToMany" src/entities/*.ts 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. Map entity relationships:
   - One-to-One
   - One-to-Many
   - Many-to-Many

**Output format:**

```
[Entity A] --[relationship]--> [Entity B]
Example: User --has many--> Orders
```

### Step 4: Business Rule Discovery

**Actions:**

1. Look for validation logic:

   ```bash
   grep -r "validate\|check\|verify\|must\|should" --include="*.ts" src/services/
   ```

2. Check for business constraints:

   ```bash
   grep -r "throw.*Error\|throw new" --include="*.ts" -B2 src/
   ```

3. Review comments for business rules:
   ```bash
   grep -r "//.*business\|//.*rule\|//.*must" --include="*.ts" src/
   ```

**Output format:**

```
Rule: [Name]
- Description: [What it enforces]
- Found in: [File:line]
```

### Step 5: UI Terminology Discovery

**Actions:**

1. Check i18n/translation files:

   ```bash
   cat src/locales/en.json public/locales/en/*.json 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. Look at form labels and UI text:

   ```bash
   grep -r "label\|placeholder\|title" --include="*.tsx" src/components/
   ```

3. Review error messages:
   ```bash
   grep -r "message.*:" --include="*.ts" src/
   ```

## Tips

1. **Prioritize core entities** - Focus on main business objects first
2. **Include technical AND business names** - Bridge dev and business language
3. **Document relationships visually** - Mermaid diagrams help understanding
4. **Capture state flows** - Critical for test scenarios
5. **Link to code** - Include file paths for traceability
