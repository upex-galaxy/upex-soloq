## Tavily vs Context7

| Scenario                    | Context7 | Tavily |
| --------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| "How to use page.click()?"  | ✅       | ❌     |
| "Error timeout in tests"    | ❌       | ✅     |
| "Playwright API reference"  | ✅       | ❌     |
| "Best practices for tests"  | ❌       | ✅     |
| "Known bugs in Playwright"  | ❌       | ✅     |

**Rule**: Context7 for **"how to use"**, Tavily for **"how to solve"**.

---

## Search Tips

1. **Include Error Messages**: Copy the exact error text
2. **Add Context**: "Playwright + TypeScript + timeout error"
3. **Specify Source**: "site:stackoverflow.com" for Stack Overflow only
4. **Include Version**: "Playwright 1.42 + flaky tests"
