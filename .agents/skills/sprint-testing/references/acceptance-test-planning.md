# Acceptance Test Planning (Ticket-Level ATP)

Stage 1 Planning for a single ticket inside a sprint. Produces `test-analysis.md` (ATP mirror) inside the ticket's PBI folder plus a Jira / TMS comment mirror and ticket refinements.

This reference is for **manual / exploratory in-sprint testing per ticket RIGHT NOW**. It does **not** create Xray TC entities (see `test-documentation` for Stage 4), compute ROI scores (see `test-documentation`), or produce automation `spec.md` (see `test-automation/planning-playbook.md`). Bug reports are covered in `reporting-templates.md` (pass 5c).

For feature / multi-story scope see `feature-test-planning.md`.

## The 4 Pillars of Spec-Driven Testing

Every phase in this document is an application of **Spec-Driven Testing (SDT)**: the specification defines what to test, not the tester's intuition. The four pillars are:

### 1. Test from Specs

```
BAD:  "I'm going to test the login and see what I find"
GOOD: "I'm going to verify that STORY-XXX meets its acceptance criteria"
```

Before testing: read the complete story, understand its ACs, and review documented test cases. The specification already defines coverage — testing does not invent it.

### 2. Traceability

```
BAD:  Bug: "The button doesn't work"
GOOD: Bug: "AC-3 of STORY-XXX fails: The submit button doesn't respond after click"
```

Every finding (pass, fail, or bug) must reference the story AND the specific AC it validates or violates. Phase 6 of this reference enforces this.

### 3. Coverage from Requirements

```
BAD:  "I tested everything I could think of"
GOOD: "I verified each AC and its documented edge cases"
```

Coverage is measured by: % of ACs verified, % of test outlines executed, and edge cases covered. Phase 4 builds the outline set that makes this measurable.

### 4. Exploratory with Purpose

```
BAD:  Random clicking through the application
GOOD: Focused exploration on the story's risk areas
```

Exploratory testing starts from the story and its ACs, looks for undocumented edge cases, and documents findings with full traceability. Phase 2 surfaces these; Phase 5 catalogs them.

### SDT anti-patterns (reject on sight)

| Anti-pattern                                                           | Problem                                           | SDT correction                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Random testing** — "click around and see what happens"               | No focus, no measurable coverage, no traceability | Start from story + ACs, produce outlines first        |
| **Test without spec** — "I didn't read the story but I'll test anyway" | Cannot distinguish bug from expected behavior     | Read the full ticket in Session Start before planning |
| **Bug without context** — "Bug: the button doesn't work"               | Dev cannot determine intended behavior            | Reference story ID + AC number + reproduction steps   |
| **Coverage by intuition** — "I tested everything I could think of"     | Subjective, gaps invisible                        | Measure against AC list + outline checklist           |

### SDT workflow (how this reference implements it)

```
Specification              Testing                    Feedback
     |                         |                          |
     v                         v                          v
+---------+    +---------+    +---------+    +---------+
|  Story  | -> |  Test   | -> | Execute | -> | Report  |
|   +AC   |    | Outlines|    | & Find  |    | & Doc   |
+---------+    +---------+    +---------+    +---------+
  Phase 1-3      Phase 4       Stage 2        Stage 3
```

The phases below (0-8) are the concrete implementation of this pipeline for a single ticket.

## Inputs

Read every item before planning. Fail fast if any project-wide context file is missing — hand off to `project-discovery`.

| Input                                                | Source                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ticket (title, description, ACs, priority, comments) | `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` using Jira Key from `{STORY_PATH}/context.md`                                |
| Team Discussion                                      | Ticket comments — extract decisions, tech notes, edge cases (see `session-entry-points.md`)         |
| Parent epic + feature plan                           | `.context/PBI/{module}/{EPIC}/feature-test-plan.md` if it exists (+ epic comments)                  |
| Project-wide context                                 | `.context/business-data-map.md`, `.context/api-architecture.md`, `.context/project-test-guide.md`   |
| Module context                                       | `.context/PBI/{module}/module-context.md`                                                           |
| Code                                                 | `{{BACKEND_REPO}}/{{BACKEND_ENTRY}}` + `{{FRONTEND_REPO}}/{{FRONTEND_ENTRY}}` (targeted reads only) |
| Test data candidates                                 | `[DB_TOOL]` on `{{DB_MCP_STAGING}}`                                                                 |
| Architecture + API contracts (if present)            | `.context/SRS/*.md`, `.context/SRS/api-contracts.yaml`                                              |

## Output

```
.context/PBI/{module-name}/{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{number}-{brief-title}/
  test-analysis.md     # ATP mirror (this doc's target output)
  context.md           # from session-start
  test-session-memory.md
  evidence/
```

Also:

- Append refined AC section to the ticket description via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, add label `shift-left-reviewed`.
- Post test-outlines comment on the ticket. `test-analysis.md` must be a byte-for-byte mirror of that comment.
- Commit `test-analysis.md` on branch `test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-desc}` with message `test({JIRA_KEY}): add shift-left test outlines for {brief-title}`.

---

## Phase 0 — Triage

Triage decides whether the ticket deserves a full ATP. **Vetoes beat risk score.**

### 0.1 Veto table

**SKIP TESTING (Code Review only):** backend-only code with no UI, infra / DevOps, static copy edits, pure CSS, documentation, tech-debt refactor with no behavior change, DB setup with no business logic.

**REQUIRE TESTING (force Full regardless of score):** money / billing, data integrity on core entities, auth / authorization, external integrations, bug fix in a critical module, calculations / formulas.

If SKIP → verify fix in code, comment on ticket, done. No ATP. If REQUIRE → skip to 0.3.

### 0.2 Risk score (only if no veto)

| Factor                  | Score | Condition                         |
| ----------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------- |
| New feature             | +3    | New functionality vs modification |
| Dynamic data (API / DB) | +3    | Not hardcoded / static            |
| Explicit ACs present    | +2    | Acceptance criteria defined       |
| User-facing             | +2    | Affects UI or visible behavior    |
| High effort             | +2    | Person-hours > 4                  |
| High priority           | +1    | Priority High or Critical         |
| Multi-component         | +1    | Multiple codebase areas touched   |

| Score | Level  | Action                                |
| ----- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 0-3   | LOW    | Code Review only (treat as SKIP veto) |
| 4-7   | MEDIUM | Full ATP (standard flow)              |
| 8+    | HIGH   | Full ATP + extended edge cases        |

Present triage result to the user before proceeding.

### 0.3 Data feasibility check

For each AC, assess whether test data is obtainable in staging. Classify using one of three patterns: **Discover** (data already exists as-is), **Modify** (existing data can be altered to match the precondition), **Generate** (must be created fresh via API/DB seeding or UI). If none applies, the AC is blocked pending data availability.

| AC  | Precondition | Data found? | Pattern                      | Notes                     |
| --- | ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| AC1 | {state}      | Yes / No    | Discover / Modify / Generate | {entity found or blocker} |

If a critical precondition has no data path → flag as risk in the ATP. If a veto-level AC blocks data, escalate to the user before writing outlines.

---

## Part 0 — Git preparation

Checkout from `staging`, pull, create branch `test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-desc}`. Only `test-analysis.md` changes land on this branch — no production code, no framework config.

---

## Phase 1 — Critical Analysis

Anchor the ticket to business + technical context.

### Business context

- Primary + secondary user personas affected
- Business value proposition + KPI influenced
- User journey and which step this ticket sits in

### Technical context

- Frontend: components, pages/routes, state management (if any)
- Backend: endpoints from `api-architecture.md` / `api-contracts.yaml`, services, DB tables
- External services (if any)
- Integration points specific to this ticket

### Story complexity

Rate Low / Medium / High on each axis: business logic, integration, data validation, UI. Estimate test effort. This drives coverage expectations in Phase 4.

### Epic-level inheritance

From the feature plan + epic comments:

- Epic-level risks that apply to this ticket (restate with ticket-level relevance)
- Integration points inherited
- PO / Dev answers already given at epic level (reuse, do not re-ask)
- Test strategy inherited (levels, tools)
- Unique considerations not covered at epic level

---

## Phase 2 — Story Quality Analysis

For each:

- **Ambiguities**: location in story + question for PO/Dev + impact on testing + suggested clarification
- **Gaps (missing info)**: type (AC / technical detail / business rule) + why critical + what to add + risk if omitted
- **Edge cases not in story**: scenario + expected behavior (best guess, flag for PO confirmation) + criticality + action (add to AC / test only / ask PO)
- **Testability validation**: Yes / Partial / No + list of issues (vague AC, missing error messages, no test data examples, missing performance criteria, cannot isolate)

If the story is already clear, say so — a short "no issues found" is better than inventing questions.

---

## Phase 3 — Refined Acceptance Criteria

Rewrite each original AC as a Given / When / Then scenario with **specific data**. Add new scenarios for edge cases surfaced in Phase 2.

Template per scenario:

- **Type**: Positive / Negative / Boundary / Edge
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Given**: initial system state + preconditions (user role, pre-existing data, configuration)
- **When**: the triggering action with exact input values
- **Then**: expected UI result + API status+body (if applicable) + DB changes + system state

For Negative scenarios include the exact error message, status code, response error shape, and a "no DB change" verification.

Mark edge-case scenarios sourced from Phase 2 with **NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION** until answered.

Do not force a minimum scenario count. A 1-line AC may only need 1 scenario. A complex money flow may need 12.

---

## Phase 4 — Test Design (Test Outlines)

### Coverage estimate

| Type        | Count | Notes                                               |
| ----------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive    | X     | Happy path variants                                 |
| Negative    | Y     | Invalid inputs, unauthorized access, missing fields |
| Boundary    | Z     | Min / max / empty / null / unicode / special chars  |
| Integration | W     | Per integration point from Phase 1                  |
| API         | V     | Per endpoint touched                                |

Rationale paragraph: why this count, given the complexity axes from Phase 1.

### Parametrization

Identify groups where the same behavior runs with varying data. Render each group as:

| Param 1 | Param 2 | …   | Expected |
| ------- | ------- | --- | -------- |

State total tests from parametrization and the benefit (deduplication, broader input coverage). If no parametrization, briefly explain why.

### Test outline naming (Shift-Left convention)

Format: `Should <BEHAVIOR> <CONDITION>`.

- **BEHAVIOR** = verb + object (login successfully, display error, calculate total)
- **CONDITION** = context that makes the case unique (with valid credentials, when field is empty, for premium users, at limit)

Examples:

- Positive — "Should login successfully with valid credentials"
- Negative — "Should display authentication error when password is incorrect"
- Boundary — "Should accept character limit when entering exactly 50 chars"
- Edge — "Should handle cart when there are multiple same items"

Anti-patterns: `Login test`, `Login - error`, `Test the form`, `Negative case`. Always describe behavior AND condition.

**Note:** In Stage 4 `test-documentation` prepends `<TS_ID>: TC#:` to formalize these in Xray. Do not add the prefix here — this is manual / shift-left, not formal TC.

### Outline structure (per scenario)

For every outline produce:

- **Title** (Should … with …)
- **Related scenario** (Phase 3 reference)
- **Type / Priority / Test level** (UI / API / Integration / E2E)
- **Parametrized** (Yes + group / No)
- **Preconditions**: specific initial state, pre-existing data, user role
- **Test steps**: numbered actions with exact data (Data: Field1: "value1", …) and verifications (Verify: …)
- **Expected result**: UI visual / message, API status+body JSON, DB state change with table + record + fields, system state change
- **Test data**: JSON block of inputs and user context
- **Post-conditions**: state after test, cleanup if any

Repeat for all scenarios identified in Phase 3. Do not truncate the list.

### Integration outlines (if applicable)

For each integration point from Phase 1:

- **Integration point**: FE↔API, API↔DB, API↔External
- **Preconditions**: what must be running (backend up, mock configured, etc.)
- **Flow**: request → processing → response → downstream
- **Contract validation**: assertions against OpenAPI spec (request shape, response shape, status codes)
- **Mock strategy**: for external services (MSW / Nock / provider test mode); real integration validated in staging manually
- **Expected result**: data flows correctly through the chain, no loss / transformation error

---

## Phase 5 — Edge case + Test-data summary

### Edge case table

| Edge case | In original story? | Added to refined AC? | Outline | Priority |

### Test-data categories

| Data type | Count | Purpose | Examples |
| Valid / Invalid / Boundary / Edge |

### Data generation strategy

- **Static**: hardcoded because critical / specific
- **Dynamic (Faker.js)**: `faker.internet.email()`, `faker.person.firstName()`, `faker.number.int({min, max})`, `faker.date.recent()`
- **Cleanup**: tests idempotent, data cleaned after execution, order-independent

---

## Phase 6 — Traceability + Ticket updates

### Update ticket in Jira / TMS

Append "QA Refinements (Shift-Left Analysis)" section to the ticket description:

- Refined Acceptance Criteria (Phase 3)
- Edge Cases Identified (Phase 2)
- Clarified Business Rules (Phase 2)

Add label `shift-left-reviewed`.

### Comment with full outlines

Post the full `test-analysis.md` body as a comment with mentions for @PO, @Dev, @QA per project convention. Include an Action Required checklist (review ambiguities, answer critical questions, confirm edge-case behavior, validate parametrization strategy).

### Mirror local file

Write `test-analysis.md` at the ticket's PBI folder with **identical** content to the ticket comment. This is the source of truth for git.

### Traceability check

After writing, run `[TMS_TOOL] trace {TICKET}` and verify Ticket → ATP link exists. TCs are not created in this skill — the trace is for the ATP artifact alone. Bugs produce ATP + ATR with no TCs (the bug is the implicit test case); "missing TC" warnings on bugs are expected.

---

## Phase 7 — Final QA Feedback Report to the user

Executive summary covering:

- Story quality assessment (Good / Needs Improvement / Significant Issues)
- Key findings (1-3 bullets)
- Critical Questions for PO (with context + impact-if-unanswered + suggested answer if possible)
- Technical Questions for Dev (with context + testing impact)
- Suggested story improvements (current state → suggested change → benefit)
- Testing recommendations (pre / during / post implementation)
- Risks & mitigation (likelihood / impact / which outlines mitigate)
- What was done (Jira updates + local files + test coverage totals)
- Next steps + **BLOCKER** note if PO/Dev answers are required before Dev starts

If risk is HIGH, add an extended-edge-cases callout and recommend a pre-implementation exploratory session.

---

## Phase 8 — Commit

On branch `test/{JIRA_KEY}/{short-desc}`:

```
git add .context/PBI/{module}/{TICKET}/test-analysis.md
git commit -m "test({JIRA_KEY}): add shift-left test outlines for {brief-title}"
```

Never include AI-attribution. Never amend pushed commits. Never push to `main` without explicit user confirmation (see SKILL.md Gotchas).

---

## Bug Analysis variant

Bugs get ATP + ATR but **no TCs** — the bug ticket is the implicit test case. Replace Phases 1-4 with:

- **Reproduction**: exact steps from the bug ticket → expected vs actual
- **Root cause hypothesis** (from code exploration)
- **Fix verification plan**: the steps that must now pass on staging
- **Regression surface**: adjacent areas that could be destabilized by the fix
- **Data integrity check**: if the bug touched persisted state, list the DB queries to run via `[DB_TOOL]` to confirm no orphaned records

Keep Phases 5-8 unchanged. Skip Phase 3 refinement since the bug ticket itself is the spec.

See SKILL.md veto rules — veto beats risk score for bugs too.

---

## Gotchas

1. **Plan before code** — no outline writing before the user OKs the story explanation from Session Start.
2. **Specific data in scenarios** — "valid email" is not enough; write `"john+test@example.com"`.
3. **Edge cases flagged for PO** — if you invented the expected behavior, mark it **NEEDS PO/DEV CONFIRMATION** and call it out in the final report.
4. **Do not force minimum counts** — a legitimately simple ticket may have 2 outlines. Forcing 10 dilutes value.
5. **Traceability now, TCs later** — this skill produces the ATP only. Stage 4 `test-documentation` turns these outlines into Xray TCs with ROI scoring.
6. **Epic inheritance beats duplication** — if the feature plan already answered a risk or integration point, cite it, do not re-derive.
7. **Language** — artifacts + commit messages in English; conversation mirrors the user's language.
8. **Data feasibility is a blocker** — if a critical AC has no reachable data, stop and surface the blocker before writing outlines.
9. **Mirror order** — Jira / TMS comment is the canonical; local file is the exact mirror. Never let them diverge.
10. **No ROI here** — prioritization for regression backlog is `test-documentation`'s job; this skill only tags Priority per outline.
