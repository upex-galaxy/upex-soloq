# Sprint Orchestration — Batch-Sprint Mode

Use this reference when iterating multiple tickets in a sprint. Covers: generating the `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md` framework file, the per-ticket orchestration loop, checkpoint mechanics, stop/pause/resume logic, and the `continue-from` parameter. Single-ticket mode is described in `session-entry-points.md`.

---

## Parameters

| Parameter       | Required | Meaning                                                              |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sprint-file`   | YES      | Path to the framework file, e.g. `.context/PBI/SPRINT-5-TESTING.md`. |
| `continue-from` | NO       | Ticket ID (e.g. `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-277`) to resume from.               |

If a parameter is missing, ASK the user before proceeding. Before starting, verify:

1. The file exists and is readable.
2. It contains at least one ticket row with a recognizable status (`PENDING`, `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED`, `SKIPPED`).
3. If `continue-from` was provided, the ticket ID exists in the file. If not, list the available tickets and ask.

---

## Orchestrator ground rules

You are the ORCHESTRATOR for in-sprint QA on `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`. Manage the workflow by dispatching sub-agents per stage, maintaining shared memory, and interacting with the user at defined checkpoints.

1. NEVER execute testing stages yourself. ALWAYS delegate to a sub-agent via the Agent tool (sequential fallback when sub-agents are unavailable).
2. Sub-agents run SEQUENTIALLY — one stage at a time. Wait for completion before dispatching the next.
3. After every sub-agent finishes, re-read `test-session-memory.md` and present a brief summary to the user.
4. TOOL FAILURE -> STOP, surface error, do NOT dispatch next sub-agent, wait for user instructions.
5. BUG_FOUND -> PAUSE, present bug to user, wait for decision.

---

## Part 1 — Generating the framework file

Use when the user asks "generate the sprint testing framework", "set up sprint N", or when `sprint-file` is missing.

### Inputs

| Parameter              | Required | Description                                        | Example                            |
| ---------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `sprint_number`        | YES      | Sprint to generate                                 | `10`                               |
| `qa_lead`              | NO       | Defaults to `git config user.name`, ask if missing | `Jane Doe`                         |
| `previous_sprint_file` | NO       | For carryover detection                            | `.context/PBI/SPRINT-9-TESTING.md` |

Output path: `.context/PBI/SPRINT-{sprint_number}-TESTING.md`. If it already exists, warn + ask before overwriting.

### Steps

1. **Query tickets** via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]` for `Sprint {N}` with fields: Ticket ID, Type, Title, Priority, Status, QA Assignee, Developer, Project/Epic, Platform. Sort by Priority DESC, Status ASC.
2. **Classify** each ticket's board status:

   | Board Status                  | QA Category            | Wave              |
   | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
   | DevStage / QA Ready / Testing | Active testing queue   | Wave 1            |
   | TestedDevStage (no artifacts) | Missing formal testing | Wave 1 (priority) |
   | Dev Complete (Merged)         | Next deploy candidates | Wave 2            |
   | Dev Complete (In Review)      | Pipeline               | Wave 2            |
   | In Progress                   | Still in development   | Pipeline          |
   | Blocked                       | Monitor                | Pipeline          |
   | Prioritized / Backlog         | Not started            | Backlog           |
   | Done                          | Completed              | Done              |
   | Cancelled                     | No action              | Cancelled         |

   Status names are project-specific — adapt to `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}`. Principle: tickets closest to "ready for QA" go in Wave 1.

3. **Detect carryovers** if `previous_sprint_file` was provided. Scan it for tickets whose status is NOT `PASSED` / `CANCELLED` / `Done`. For each, check whether it appears in the current sprint; if yes mark as carryover with prior context; if no note as "dropped from sprint" and inform the user.
4. **Organize waves**:
   - Wave 1 = DevStage / QA Ready + tickets in a "tested" state missing formal artifacts. Sort: Priority then QA assignment.
   - Wave 2 = Dev Complete split into "Merged on Dev" + "Ready for Review", sort by Priority.
   - Pipeline = In Progress + Blocked, grouped separately.
   - Backlog / Done / Cancelled listed for completeness.
5. **Detect QA automation tasks**: `Type = QA Task` OR title contains "E2E Tests" / "Integration Tests", assigned to `qa_lead`. Collect into their own section.
6. **Write** the file using the structure below.
7. **Report** a short board summary: totals, wave counts, carryovers.

### Framework file structure

```markdown
# Sprint {N} - In-Sprint Testing Tracker

> Purpose: track QA testing progress; provide AI context for resuming sessions.
> Sprint: {N} | QA: {qa_lead} | Started: {YYYY-MM-DD} | Last Updated: {date} (initial generation)

## Session Log

### {YYYY-MM-DD} - Sprint {N} Setup & Triage

- Queried {{ISSUE_TRACKER}}: {total} tickets in Sprint {N}
- {wave1_count} DevStage tickets identified ({list IDs})
- {assigned_count} assigned to {qa_lead}, {unassigned_count} unassigned
- {carryover_count} carryovers from Sprint {N-1}: {list}
- Created SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md tracker
```

### Framework file conventions

1. **Status column in Wave 1**: the orchestrator scans for `PENDING` to pick the next ticket. Valid values during a sprint: `PENDING`, `PASSED`, `FAILED`, `BLOCKED`, `DEFERRED`, `SKIPPED`.
2. **ATP / ATR / TCs columns**: initialized as `-`; updated AFTER Stage 3 completes for each ticket (e.g. `51`, `61`, `4`).
3. **Priority order** inside Wave 1: the `#` column determines testing order — pick the lowest-numbered `PENDING`. Order: Critical bugs -> Critical features -> High -> Medium -> Low.
4. **Wave promotion**: when tickets move to DevStage mid-sprint, append them to a new wave section (Wave 2 becomes active, renumber). Read the latest wave with `PENDING` tickets.
5. **Session Log**: each testing session appends an entry. Provides continuity across AI sessions.

## Part 2 — The per-ticket loop

```
ORCHESTRATOR                           SUB-AGENTS
    |
    |-> Read SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md
    |-> Pick next ticket (see STEP 1)
    |
    |-> Dispatch SESSION START ------> Creates PBI + context.md + test-session-memory.md
    |-> Present Story Explanation, WAIT for user OK
    |
    |-> Dispatch PLANNING ----------> Updates memory (artifacts, test data)
    |-> Brief user (1-2 lines)
    |
    |-> Dispatch EXECUTION ---------> Updates memory (TC statuses, findings)
    |-> If BUG_FOUND: present, WAIT for user decision
    |
    |-> Dispatch REPORTING ---------> Updates memory (final status)
    |-> Verify Checklist
    |-> Update SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md (Status, ATP, ATR, TCs)
    |-> Present per-ticket summary, WAIT for user OK
    |-> Loop to next ticket
```

### STEP 1 — Auto-detect the next ticket

Scan the sprint file in this order:

1. If `continue-from` was provided, jump directly to that ticket.
2. "Missing Formal Testing" section — tickets in a tested state with no ATP/ATR. Process these first (retroactive formal testing).
3. Current wave (Wave 1 by default) — first ticket with `Status = PENDING`.
4. If the current wave is done, check whether a new wave has formed and repeat.

Once chosen: note ID / type / title / priority, check for an existing `test-session-memory.md` (interrupted session), tell the user which ticket and why.

### STEP 2 — Dispatch sub-agents per workflow

| Ticket Type                                        | Sub-agent 1   | Sub-agent 2                               | Sub-agent 3             | Sub-agent 4             |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Feature / Product Roadmap / UX-UI / Task / QA Task | Session Start | Stage 1 Planning (Feature)                | Stage 2 Execution       | Stage 3 Reporting       |
| Bug                                                | Session Start | Bug Planning (Phase 1: Triage + Planning) | Bug Execution (Phase 2) | Bug Reporting (Phase 3) |

## Sub-agent prompt templates

Every template shares the same shell below. The orchestrator fills `{placeholders}` per sub-agent, then adds the sub-agent-specific TASK block from the matrix that follows. Detailed step instructions for each stage live in the stage-specific reference — do NOT duplicate them here.

### Shared shell

```
ROLE: QA sub-agent executing {STAGE} for {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{number}.

REFERENCES TO LOAD: {reference name from matrix}

CONTEXT FILES TO READ (in order):
  1. {test-session-memory.md path}   # READ THIS FIRST (except Session Start — writes it)
  2. {context.md path}
  3. {module-context.md path}
  # Session Start reads instead: .context/business-data-map.md, .context/api-architecture.md, .context/project-test-guide.md

TICKET: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{number} -- {title}
TYPE: {type}
PRIORITY: {priority}
TEST DATA: {from memory, when relevant}

TASK: {stage-specific steps — see matrix}

MEMORY UPDATE: before finishing, update the relevant section of test-session-memory.md
  (Stage Results > {Stage}; TMS Artifacts; Test Data; Bugs Found; Observations).

EXIT CHECKLIST: in memory.md > Checklist > {Stage}, mark [x] every completed item.
  Leave [ ] + explanation in Observations for any uncompleted item.

REPORT BACK: structured summary — see matrix.

IMPORTANT: credentials always from .env. Never hardcode. Never ask the user for
  confirmation yourself — the orchestrator handles user interaction.
```

- [ ] Bugs documented (if found)

### Reporting

- [ ] ATR report filled and marked complete
- [ ] test-report.md created in PBI
- [ ] QA comment posted
- [ ] Ticket transitioned to tested state
```

## STEP 4 — Post-ticket actions (orchestrator-owned)

After Sub-agent 4 finishes:

1. Read the final `test-session-memory.md`.
2. Verify the Checklist (STEP 5 below).
3. Update `SPRINT-{N}-TESTING.md`:
   - Change Status `PENDING` -> `PASSED` / `FAILED`.
   - Fill ATP / ATR / TCs columns.
   - Update the Stats section.
4. Present a per-ticket summary:

   ```
   TICKET: {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{XXX} -- {title}
   TYPE: {type} | PRIORITY: {priority} | RESULT: {PASSED/FAILED}
   ARTIFACTS: ATP-{N}, ATR-{N}, TCs: {list}
   BUGS: {count or none} | AC GAPS: {count or none}
   OBSERVATIONS: {if any}

   Remaining queue:
   {list remaining PENDING tickets with priority}

   Ready for next ticket? (waiting for OK)
   ```

5. WAIT for user OK before the next ticket.

---

## STEP 5 — Final verification (orchestrator)

Inspect `test-session-memory.md > Checklist`.

1. Count `[x]` vs `[ ]` across all stages, filtering by ticket type (Feature or Bug).
2. All applicable `[x]`: proceed to update the sprint file.
3. Any applicable `[ ]` still:
   - Check Observations for the reason.
   - Valid reason (e.g. "N/A — no UI changes"): proceed.
   - Missing / unclear: inform the user and ask before marking done.
4. Orchestrator-only items:
   - [ ] Story explained and confirmation received
   - [ ] Sprint testing file updated
   - [ ] Final summary presented to user

---

## STEP 6 — Interrupted session recovery

If `test-session-memory.md` already exists for the next ticket:

1. Read it to determine the last completed stage.
2. Inform the user: "Found interrupted session for `{{PROJECT_KEY}}-{XXX}`. Last completed: {stage}. Resuming from {next stage}."
3. Skip completed stages; dispatch the next sub-agent in sequence.
4. The sub-agent reads the existing memory and continues from there.

Same procedure when `continue-from` is given.

## STEP 7 — Session summary (before wrapping up)

When the user indicates they are done (or wrapping up), present:

```markdown
## Sprint {N} -- Session Summary ({date})

| #   | Ticket              | Type   | Priority   | Title   | Result                  | Board Status   | Dev   | TCs           | AC Gaps         | Bugs            | Artifacts                    |
| --- | ------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | ----- | ------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | {{PROJECT_KEY}}-{X} | {type} | {priority} | {title} | {PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED} | {board status} | {dev} | {X/Y (rate%)} | {count or None} | {count or None} | ATP-{N}, ATR-{N}, TCs {list} |
```

**Column definitions**: Type (Bug / Product Roadmap / Feature / Task); Priority (Critical / High / Medium / Not as Important); Result (PASSED / FAILED / SKIPPED + reason); Board Status (current on `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}`); Dev (implementer); TCs (pass/total + rate; for bugs "DB verified" or "N/A"); AC Gaps (None if all verified); Bugs (None if clean); Artifacts (IDs).

After the table:

```
Session stats: {X} tickets tested, {Y} TCs executed, {Z}% pass rate
Remaining queue: {list remaining PENDING tickets with priority}
```

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Sub-agent returns `Status: BLOCKED`                                                                | Do NOT advance. Show reason, wait for user.      |
| Sub-agent reports TOOL FAILURE (MCP / `[AUTOMATION_TOOL]` / `[TMS_TOOL]` / `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`) | Stop, surface error, wait for user instructions. |
| Sub-agent reports BUG_FOUND                                                                        | Pause, present bug, wait for user decision.      |
| Framework file missing / malformed                                                                 | Offer to (re)generate via Part 1.                |
| `continue-from` ticket not in file                                                                 | List available tickets, ask user to confirm.     |

Never proceed silently past an error.
